# Contributing

As this project is mostly for myself, I am not looking for contributors per se.

However, if you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. I will try to respond as soon as possible.

Both are very appreciated, as long as you're patient with me. I'm not always able to respond quickly.
