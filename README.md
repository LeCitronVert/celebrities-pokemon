# PokeCelebrities

## Description

This is a simple web application that allows users to enter someone's name and get a Pokémon team based on the name's characters.

This was first made to be used on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@citronenglishmode), but I decided to make it public so that my humble, messy code could be enjoyed by everyone.

## Usage

To use the application, simply enter a name in the input field and click the "Submit" button. The application will then generate a Pokémon team based on the name's characters.

The webpage is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://lecitronvert.github.io/celebrities-pokemon/).

You can also run the application locally by cloning the repository or downloading the source code. Keep in mind that, because I'm using ES6 Modules and *.mjs files, you'll need to run the application on a server. Any worth its salt should do.

## Credits

- The application uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to get the Pokémon data.
- The application uses [PokeAPI/pokeapi-js-wrapper](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi-js-wrapper) to interact with the PokeAPI.
- The application uses a rip of Gen 5 sprites from Rick1234.

## TODO

- Adding an autocomplete feature to the input field. On some sort of celebrity API ?
- Adding a randomly generated trainer class related to the sprite.
